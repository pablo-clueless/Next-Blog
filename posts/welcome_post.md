## Welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm very elated to start this blog. This project was like a test for me when I started learning Next.js and it's been a wonderful journey. It's been barely 4 days but I'm allowed to say it's a journey, right? Of course I am. This project is created with Next.js and Markdown, a very simple static blog that was inspired by Next.js's easy routing. I'm not gonna lie, I had ideas of doing several project in React but the routing made me lethargic, although I still got some done. But when I started Next.js, the easy routing made me open to the endless possibilities. Big thanks to [@williams_code](https://twitter.com/williams_codes) for giving me the heads up and pushing me to take it up, he's a top top fella.

I'm gonna be updating this blog occassionally 'cos there's still [Hashnode](https://hashnode.dev) to worry about. I'm currently trying to up my writing skills and document my learning process better. But this is my baby, I'll try to keep up with it.

## How it's been with React and Next.js üöÄ

Learning React has been fun and tasking, given it has it's own rules and you can't just `document.querySelector` anything anyhow which makes it somehow confusing. But the hooks are wonderful, they make DOM manipulation kinda sleek and I can't imagine life before them. And building by components is also very cool, especially when you need to have same components in multiple places. Then came Next.js which was built on top of React and solved the issue of routing and SEO optimization. Next.js is amazingly cool, like really cool. It uses React like syntax with all hooks and all, since it's biult on top of React but it is more robust than React. And the data fecthing methods are different, you need to wrap your `fetch` or `axios` inside these very cool functions called `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` depending on if you want your data fetched at build time or pre-fetched. Overall, I'm enjoying working with Next.js and I think I'm gonna rebuild my portfolio site with it. Oh! And Next has this very cool module css thing which makes your css file behave like an object, you import your styles and add class names using the JavaScript dot notation. It's like *object-oriented programming* taken to a whole new level. It's all just too cool and overwhelming.

## Conclusion

Forgive me, I tend to get too carried away. Anyhoo, check out my Hashnode at [FrontendPablo](https://frontendpablo.hashnode.dev/), I've got articles there about web development. I plan to take this blog to another level as part of my portfolio projects, so stay tuned. Thanks for reading and goodbye.

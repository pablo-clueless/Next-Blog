Using `for` and `while` loops is kinda outdated. It can get bloated and messy especially when dealing with large programs giving room for bugs to hide, it can be restricting and it is SLOW because it has to read the length of the entire array at every iteration of the loop. And in comes, *drum roll please*... Higher Order Array Methods to the rescue.

## Summary

We will learn to use Higher Order Functions to interact with an Array. I'll give examples of how it might be done in ES5, then how it will be done in ES6 using arrow function.

## Prerequisite

You should be familiar with functions, arrays and loops in JavaSript.

## Higher Order Functions

![defi.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635964803274/n1ptUpQ4G.png)

Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by receiving them as arguments or by returning them. It is a function that accepts a function as a parameter or returns a function as the output. It is important to note that these methods are ES6 syntax so let's familiarize ourselves with how they work. If you were defining a function in ES5, it would look like this:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
   return a + b
}
```

With the introduction of *Arrow functions* in ES6, the above code will look like this:

```js
const sum = (a,b) => a + b;
```

ES6 has 'syntactic sugar' which is a fancy way of saying of saying it makes syntax easier to read and express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer. When dealing with one parameter and/or a simple logic, there is no need for the parenthesis or `return` keyword:

```js
//ES5 syntax
function square(num) {
   return num * num
};

//ES6 syntax
const square = num => num * num;
```

Also,

```js
//ES5 syntax
function averageOfThree (a, b, c) {
    var sum = a + b + c;
    return sum / 3;
};

//ES6 syntax
const averageOfThree = (a, b, c) => {
   var sum = a + b + c;
   return sum / 3
}
```

Both code will evaluate to same result. With that out of the way, let's see the Array methods.

### Array Methods

We are going to be looking at the following Array methods. These are some of the commonly used ones:

- forEach()
- filter()
- map()
- sort()
- reduce()

#### Array.prototype.forEach

`syntax: array.forEach(callback)`

This is one of the simplest functions you are going to use while working with Arrays. The `forEach()` method is similar to the `for(let i = 0; i < array.length, i++){}` syntax. It loops through the array and runs the given callback for each of the elements of the array. The callback function passed to the `forEach()` function can accept the current item, index, array. Let's create an array, like so:

```js
const ages = [33, 12, 20, 16, 5, 54, 21, 44, 61, 13, 15, 45, 25, 64, 32];
```

In ES5 if you wanted to loop through the array, you would have something like this:

```js
for (let i =0; i < ages.length; i++){
   console.log(ages[i]);
}
```

Using the `forEach()` method would be like this:

```js
ages.forEach(function(age, index, ages){
   console.log(age, index, ages)
}
```

And we could simply the code further by using the ES6 arrow function:

```js
ages.forEach((age, index, ages) => console.log(age, index, ages)
```

All the code block do the same thing but the ES6 arrow function gives you a clean one-liner.

#### Array.prototype.filter

`syntax: array.filter(callback)`

The `filter()` function is what you'd use if you're looking to 'filter out' or select an item from a given list of items, for example when using a search bar. The `filter()` method creates a new array by executing the passed callback on every element of the array, and keeps it in the resulting array IF and ONLY IF the element passes the Boolean test returned by the callback. The callback passed into the `filter()` method accepts any of the three arguments: item, index and array; same as the `forEach()` method. for example, let's say we want to get the ages above 20 from our array to create a list of people who can order alcoholic drinks at a bar. Let's use the ES5 syntax first:

```js
//create 
let canDrink = [];
for (let i = 0; i < ages.length; i++){
   if(ages[i] >= 20){
      canDrink.push(ages[i]);
   }
}
console.log(canDrink);
```

Using the `filter()` method:

```js
const canDrink = ages.filter(funtion(age) {
   if(age >= 21){
      return true;
   }
}
console.log(canDrink);
```

And below is the ultimate ES6 one-liner:

```js
const canDrink = ages.filter(age => age >= 20);
console.log(canDrink);
```

#### Array.prototype.map

`syntax: array.map(callback)`

The `map()` method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function. The callback also takes in the current item, index and array. Here is an example:

```js
const companies = [
{name: 'Company One', type: 'Retail', owner: 'John Doe'},
{name: 'Company Two', type: 'Auto', owner: 'Jane Doe'},
{name: 'Company Three', type: 'Tech', owner: 'James Doe'},
{name: 'Company Four', type: 'Construction', owner: 'Janet Doe'},
{name: 'Company Five', type: 'Pharmaceutical', owner: 'Julian Doe'},
{name: 'Company Six', type: 'Publishing', owner: 'Jasmine Doe'},
{name: 'Company Seven', type: 'Electrical', owner: 'Jacob Doe'}
];
const companyName = companies.map(company => company.name);
console.log(companyName);
```

The above example will return an array of only the company names. The original has be *mutated* or mapped into a new one. The `map()` method is similar to `forEach()` and could be used interchangeably for most applications but remember that `map()` returns a **new array**.

#### Array.prototype.sort

`syntax: array.sort(callback)`

The sort method is self-explanatory: it "sorts" an array *in place* and returns a sorted the array. The default sort order is ascending. **In place** means that the original array is changed and the same reference to the array is returned. Note that, if the original array is already sorted, then `originalArray === newArray`. It takes a callback function that specifies the criteria for sorting. Let's sort the ages array:

```js
const ages = [33, 12, 20, 16, 5, 54, 21, 44, 61, 13, 15, 45, 25, 64, 32];
const sortedAges = ages.sort()
console.log(sortedAges);
```

Now you'll notice that you get something like this:

```js
[12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21, 25, 32, 33, 44, 45, 5, 54, 61, 64]
```

We expect the `sort()` method to sort the array in ascending order but `33` is coming before `5`. Here's why: `sort()` assumes that all the array elements are String by default, and sorts the elements based on the UTF-16 code values, in case it is not passed any callback. This is why `33` will come before `5`. So, we need to pass in a sorting criteria as a callback function:

```js
const sortedAges = ages.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(sortedAges);
```

This is better now, isn't it? What we did was tell the function to evaluate 2 values and return their results. So:

- If `callback(a, b)` returns less than 0, a comes before b.
- If `callback(a, b)` returns 0, a and b are left at their current index.
- If `callback(a, b)` returns greater than 0, b comes before a

Note that callback(a, b) must always return the same value when given a specific pair of elements a and b as its two arguments. And if you want to return the values in descending order, all you have to do it change the sorting criteria like so:

```js
const sortInDescending = ages.sort((a, b) => b - a;
console.log(sortInDescending);
```

#### Array.prototype.reduce

`syntax: array.reduce()`

The `reduce()` method is especially useful whenever you need to compute a single value based on the data stored in an array. As the name suggests, this reduces an array into a single value but can get quite complicated. The callback function that this method accepts, works on each element of the array in a way that reduces the array to a single value. The `reduce()` function itself takes two inputs: (a) the reducer function or callback; (b) an optional starting point or initialValue. The callback function(or reducerCallback) accepts 4 arguments: accumulator, current item, index, array. Let's see an simple example using the `for loop`:

```js
let sumOfAges = 0;
for(let i = 0; i < ages.length; i++){
   sumOfAges += ages[i];
}
console.log(sumOfAges);
```

The code above should return **460**. Now using the `redue()` method:

```js
const sumOfAges = ages.reduce(function(total, age){
return total + age;
}, 0)
console.log(sumOfAges);
```

The above is as messier, if not messier, than the `for loop`. Now the legendary ES6 one-liner:

```js
const sumOfAges = ages.reduce((total, age) => total + age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges);

```

In the code above the accumulator is `total`, the current item is `age`, the initial value is `0`. The basic idea is that the value in `accumulator` is persisted each time the callback method is executed. This means that if the `reducerCallback` is executed for the 2nd element of `ages`, then the values of the arguments `accumulator` and `current` are 33 and 12 respectively. The callback then adds these two values and returns them. This returned value is now the new value stored in `accumulator`. So, for the 3rd callback execution, the values of `accumulator` and `current` are 45 and 20. You can see how the arrayâ€™s values are being used to get to a single value. Remember the second argument called `initialValue` in the syntax. This is set as the initial value of the `accumulator` variable. In case you do not specify any`initialValue` argument, `accumulator` will take the array element at the 0th index as its default initial value.

## Conclusion

I know all this is a massive of information to digest at once but on the bright side, now you can start writing your own higher-order functions to deal with arrays. There are loads of others, but essentially, you need not know every method in `Array.prototype` to work with arrays. Thank you for reading this article, I hope you enjoyed it. Any feedback will be much, much appreciated: good or bad ;)
